I compiled a UX-focused reading list that filtered out the painful-to-read books so that you don't have to. I'm not a bookworm, so when a book is boring or fails to deliver value, walking on a floor filled with crushed glass sounds like a better idea to me.

My focus wasn't to create a pure UX-only reading list. I wanted a list that covered subjects that allowed me to be well-rounded and well-versed in equally important topics as a professional and an individual.

The reading list focuses heavily on UX and Design and touches upon Product Management, Entrepreneurship, and Interpersonal Communication. I also included two "flavoured" sections that interest me: Personal Finance (Investing, mostly) and BlockChain.

This list is a living document that I am actively curating. I will add books to this list based on my ability to answer the following questions with a resounding "Yes!":

- Did I read the book?
- Did I learn anything new?
- Did I enjoy reading the book?


I did not list these books in any particular order.
